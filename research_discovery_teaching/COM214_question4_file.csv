1013,"COM214",5,6406,4,"Often the readings about the content of the class are due multiple days before the content is covered in class. I'd benefit if the textbook was more of a preview of what would be covered in class as often the textbook is very dense."
1014,"COM214",5,6708,4,"Nothing, I think the textbook is a good resource."
1015,"COM214",5,6583,4,"I wish we did not have to do the writeups for each class. It adds to the workload we already have and tends to produce stress as it is due twice a week. The readings are interesting and I love the class, I just find the writeups cause stress and more pressure that does not need to exist in this class."
1016,"COM214",5,6718,4,"I find the readings very interesting and helpful during homework but I get discouraged by the forum posts. I find that 500 words is much longer than can be easily written about our homework assignments and struggle to reach the desired lenght of post despite having read and absorbed the homework content."
1017,"COM214",5,6504,4,"I am a bit overwhelmed by the volume of content for this course- I think mastering HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Ruby in the span of 4 months won't be easy"

1019,"COM214",5,6288,4,"I was thinking about maybe lowering the writing limit for the SWA. I've been finding it really hard to get to the 500 without feeling like I'm just summarizing everything I just read. It gets a bit frustrating because I feel like I'm not doing good enough on them."
1020,"COM214",5,6707,4,"I think for the programming assignments, if you could go a little more into depth about them during class, that would make me feel more comfortable. Another thing I think would be interesting is like a running list of features that we have learned through the course. The more we go the more we add, and sometimes it is overwhelming just knowing how to do simple things when there are so many things that are thrown at us."

1109,"COM214",7,6715,4,"The readings are super interesting, but I struggle to fill 500 words. It's difficult to find the motivation to keep reading knowing that I'll have to embellish some of what I'm writing simply because I can't find the content to fill the word count. The reflections are vital to tracking our understanding, but I think a lower minimum word count would be beneficial."
