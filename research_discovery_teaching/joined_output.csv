6715,7,COM214,3,3,2.5,"The readings are super interesting, but I struggle to fill 500 words. It's difficult to find the motivation to keep reading knowing that I'll have to embellish some of what I'm writing simply because I can't find the content to fill the word count. The reflections are vital to tracking our understanding, but I think a lower minimum word count would be beneficial.",I find it challenging to meet the 500-word minimum for reflections and would benefit from a lower word count requirement to better reflect my understanding without unnecessary embellishment.
6715,9,COM214,3,3,3,pls lower min word count for reflections,I would be more comfortable if the minimum word count for reflections was lowered.

6718,5,COM214,4,4,3,I find the readings very interesting and helpful during homework but I get discouraged by the forum posts. I find that 500 words is much longer than can be easily written about our homework assignments and struggle to reach the desired lenght of post despite having read and absorbed the homework content.,"I find the 500-word forum post requirement challenging and discouraging, as it's difficult to write that much about the homework even though I understand and engage with the material."
